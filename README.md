I present a novel approach to job recommendation systems, sidestepping traditional machine learning techniques. Instead, it leverages TF-IDF vectorization and a sigmoid kernel matrix to deliver personalized job recommendations based on skill-based semantic similarity.
This system was built to assist job seekers—especially students and career changers—by offering intelligent, relevant job suggestions through interpretable, user-defined models, without requiring deep ML pipelines.
✨ Features
🔍 No ML Algorithms Needed — Simplified design for easy interpretability and faster deployment.
🧠 Skill-Based Semantic Similarity — Uses TF-IDF to identify essential job skills and map similar job roles.
📈 Personalized Recommendations — Tailored suggestions based on a single input job title.
🧰 User-Centric Workflow — Designed with the user’s ease and experience in mind.
📊 25–40% Better Outcomes — Notable increases in user satisfaction, career transitions, and engagement.
